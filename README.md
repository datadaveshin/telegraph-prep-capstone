## Play version 2 here: [Tic Tac Toe Plus] (https://datadaveshin.github.io/telegraph-prep-capstone/)

# Tic Tac Toe Plus
For my nieces, I decided to make a Tic Tac Toe game. This is my first JavaScript/Web project, and it is derived from the Telegraph Prep Capstone Project.
Telegraph Prep provided starter .css and .html files, along with methods to create an 8 x 8 game board, render the board, and a click handler that would return the position of the board that the mouse clicked. From there, I modified all of the methods to generate 3 x 3 to 5 x 5 grid boards, and the logic to change the click handler from returning a square position to having the ability to make a basic Tic Tac Toe game.

## Version 2
Make version that has the option of 1 or 2 two players.

## Version 1
A basic playable Tic Tac Toe game with options to expand the board to a 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 grid.
In this version, you play against the computer. 
To make it fun for the kids, I let the computer choose it's square by random, which, I find for a 3 x 3 board, actually provides enough challenge for children - they can win!

## Plans for Version 3
The next version will incorporate some "AI". I will use Monte Carlo simulations and a scoring function to allow the computer player to make better moves. I'm choosing Monte Carlo over say a minimax algorithm, because it should be easy to set "skill" levels by changing the number of trials.
